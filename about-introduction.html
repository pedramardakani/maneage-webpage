		<h2>Introduction to Maneage</h2>
                <p>The most important element of a "scientific" statement/result is the fact
                that others should be able to falsify it. The Tsunami of data that has
                engulfed scientists in the last two decades, combined with faster
                processors and faster internet connections has made it much more easier to
                obtain a result. However, these factors have also increased the complexity
                of a scientific analysis, such that it is no longer possible to describe
                all the steps of an analysis in the published paper. Citing this
                difficulty, many authors suffice to describing the generalities of their
                analysis in their papers.</p>

                <p>However, It is impossible to falsify (or even study) a result if you can't
                exactly reproduce it. The complexity of modern science makes it vitally
                important to exactly reproduce the final result. Because even a small
                deviation can be due to many different parts of an analysis. Nature is
                already a black box which we are trying so hard to comprehend. Not letting
                other scientists see the exact steps taken to reach a result, or not
                allowing them to modify it (do experiments on it) is a self-imposed black
                box, which only exacerbates our ignorance.</p>

                <p>Other scientists should be able to reproduce, check and experiment on the
                results of anything that is to carry the "scientific" label. Any result
                that is not reproducible (due to incomplete information by the author) is
                not scientific: the readers have to have faith in the subjective experience
                of the authors in the very important choice of configuration values and
                order of operations: this is contrary to the scientific spirit.</p>

                <p>Maneage is created with the aim of supporting reproducible research by
                making it easy to start a project in this framework. As shown below, it is
                very easy to customize Maneage for any particular (research) project and
                expand it as it starts and evolves. It can be run with no modification (as
                described in <code>README.md</code>) as a demonstration and customized for use in any
                project as fully described below.</p>

                <p>A project designed using Maneage will download and build all the necessary
                libraries and programs for working in a closed environment (highly
                independent of the host operating system) with fixed versions of the
                necessary dependencies. The tarballs for building the local environment are
                also collected in a <a href="http://git.maneage.org/tarballs-software.git/tree/">separate
                    repository</a>. The final
                output of the project is <a href="http://git.maneage.org/output-raw.git/plain/paper.pdf">a
                    paper</a>.  Notice the
                last paragraph of the Acknowledgments where all the necessary software are
                mentioned with their versions.</p>

                <p>Below, we start with a discussion of why Make was chosen as the high-level
                language/framework for project management and how to learn and master Make
                easily (and freely). The general architecture and design of the project is
                then discussed to help you navigate the files and their contents. This is
                followed by a checklist for the easy/fast customization of Maneage to your
                exciting research. We continue with some tips and guidelines on how to
                manage or extend your project as it grows based on our experiences with it
                so far. The main body concludes with a description of possible future
                improvements that are planned for Maneage (but not yet implemented). As
                discussed above, we end with a short introduction on the necessity of
                reproducible science in the appendix.</p>

                <p>Please don't forget to share your thoughts, suggestions and
                criticisms. Maintaining and designing Maneage is itself a separate project,
                so please join us if you are interested. Once it is mature enough, we will
                describe it in a paper (written by all contributors) for a formal
                introduction to the community.</p>
