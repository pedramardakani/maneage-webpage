      <h2>Maneage: managing data lineage</h2>
      <p>Maneage is a framework for starting and growing projects, see <a href="pdf/slides-intro.pdf">these slides</a> for an introduction.
	Through Maneage, the complete data lineage of a project is recorded with its history and can easily be published or archived, enabling exact reproducibility.
	Maneage is a recipient of the <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/64603">RDA Europe Adoption grant</a>.
      </p>

      <p> To start a new project, simply run these commands: </p>
      <code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap;">git clone https://git.maneage.org/project.git     # Clone Maneage, default branch `maneage'.
mv project my-project && cd my-project            # Set custom name and enter directory.
git remote rename origin origin-maneage           # Rename remote server to use `origin' later.
git checkout -b master                            # Make new `master' branch, start customizing.</code>

      <p>You are now ready to configure and make the raw template with the commands below.
	If they are successful, you can start customizing it.</p>

      <code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap;">./project configure    # Build all necessary software from source.
./project make         # Do the analysis (download data, run software on data, build PDF).</code>

      <p>See the <a href="https://gitlab.com/maneage/project/-/blob/maneage/README-hacking.md#customization-checklist">Customization Checklist</a> in the cloned <code>README-hacking.md</code> file for the next steps to start customizing Maneage for your project.</p>
