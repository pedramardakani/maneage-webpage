                    Through Maneage, the complete data lineage of a project is recorded with its history and can easily be published or archived, enabling <a href="http://akhlaghi.org/reproducible-science.html">exact reproducibility</a>.
                    Maneage is a recipient of the <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/64603">RDA Europe Adoption grant</a>.

                    <h3>Start building your project in Maneage</h3>
                    <p>To start a new project, simply run these commands to clone it from its <a href="http://git.maneage.org/project.git">Git repository</a>.
                    <pre><code>git clone https://git.maneage.org/project.git     <span class="comment"># Clone Maneage, default branch `maneage'.</span>
mv project my-project && cd my-project            <span class="comment"># Set custom name and enter directory.</span>
git remote rename origin origin-maneage           <span class="comment"># Rename remote server to use `origin' later.</span>
git checkout -b master                            <span class="comment"># Make new `master' branch, start customizing.</span></code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>You are now ready to configure and make the raw template with the commands below.
                    If they are successful, you can start customizing it.
                    <pre><code>./project configure    <span class="comment"># Build all necessary software from source.</span>
./project make         <span class="comment"># Do the analysis (download data, run software on data, build PDF).</span></code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>See the <a href="https://gitlab.com/maneage/project/-/blob/maneage/README-hacking.md#customization-checklist">Customization Checklist</a> in the cloned <code>README-hacking.md</code> file for the next steps to start customizing Maneage for your project.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Merge/Pull requests</h3>
                    <p>As you continue customizing Maneage for your own project, you will notice  generic improvements that can be useful for other projects too.
                    In such cases, please send us those changes to implement in the core Maneage branch and let them propagate to all projects using it.
                    If you look through the history of the Maneage branch, you'll notice many users have already started doing this, and this is how Maneage is planned to grow.
                    The recommended process is very similar to
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/manual/html_node/Forking-tutorial.html">this forking tutorial</a>.
                    Here is a summary:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go to the <code>maneage</code> branch and create a new branch from there like below:
                            <pre><code>git checkout maneage
git branch -b my-fix</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>Commit your fix over this new branch.</li>
                        <li>Build a new project on your favorite Git repository (GitLab, BitBucket, or GitHub for example) and assign it to a new Git remote in your project.
                            Let's call it <code>my-remote</code>.
                            You only need to do this once and keep this for future fixes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Push your branch to that remote:
                            <pre><code>git push my-remote my-fix</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>Submit a link to your fork and the corresponding branch <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?func=additem&group=reproduce">on Savannah</a>.
                            If you are <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/account/register.php">registered on Savannah</a>, you can also submit it as <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&group=reproduce">a bug</a> or <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/task/?func=additem&group=reproduce">a task</a>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
